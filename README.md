## Getting Started

- The code are named with the index of the figures in the paper.  
- Run the code, and you can obtain the corresponding result in the paper.

### Prerequisites

MATLAB 2020a.

### Example

1. Open the script named Figure_3.m.  
2. Set the radial polarization ratio value in the line 14.  
```
Iz_desired = 0;
```
- The pupil function is calculated and shown as follows:

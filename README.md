# OAM-Ctrl

OAM-Ctrl is the open source code of the paper "Generation of Arbitrary Longitudinal Polarization Vortices by Pupil Function Manipulation"

## Getting Started
The code are ended with the index of the figures in paper. Run the code and the corresponding result can be obtained.

### Prerequisites

MATLAB 2020a

```
Give examples
```

### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development env running

Say what the step will be

```
Give the example
```

And repeat

```
until finished
```

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo

## Running the tests

Explain how to run the automated tests for this system

### Break down into end to end tests

For example,
1.open the script named singleLongitudinalVortexTunable_FIG4a_d.m
2.set the radial polarization ratio value in row 8
```
Iz_desired = 1;
```
The pupil function is calculated and shown as follows

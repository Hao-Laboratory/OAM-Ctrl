# OAM-Ctrl

OAM-Ctrl is the open source code of the paper "**Generation of Arbitrary Longitudinal Polarization Vortices by Pupil Function Manipulation**"

## Getting Started

- The code are ended with the index of the figures in the paper.  
- Run the code, and you can obtain the corresponding result.

### Prerequisites

MATLAB 2020a

### Example

1. Open the script named singleLongitudinalVortexTunable_FIG4a_d.m  
2. Set the radial polarization ratio value in the row 8  
```
Iz_desired = 1;
```
- The pupil function is calculated and shown as follows
